# JavaScript essentials tasks

## Introduction

This repository contains the tasks for the JavaScript essentials module. Complete the material in JavaScript Essentials
Moodle Course and Cisco Networking Academy before starting these tasks. The tasks are designed to test your knowledge
based on the material in the course.
The tasks are contained in separate folders and the code contains TODO comments where the code needs to be added.
Note that already existing code does not need to be modified unless specified in the task description.

## Getting started

### Downloading the project
To get started, you need to download the project. You can do this from the top right corner of the page from
<> Code -> Download ZIP, or from console with git: `git clone https:repository-url.git`.

### Development environment
You will need an IDE to work on these tasks. [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or 
[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is recommended. Install the IDE of your choice and open the
project folder in it.
### Running the code
The task folders contain JavaScript files and index.html files. After completing 
the tasks in the JavaScript files you can run the code by opening the index.html
file from your IDE or directly from the file system to your browser.
### Troubleshooting
If you have completed all of the tasks and the code is not working as expected in your browser you can
use the browser developer tools to debug the code. In Chrome you can open the developer tools by right clicking
on the page, selecting Inspect -> Console tab and look for possible error messages. If you get absolutely stuck,
you can look for solutions in the answers folder. Try your best at solving the tasks before looking at the answers.

## Tasks

### Task 1
Open the folder Task 1
Your first task is to create a JavaScript class for a game character with properties and methods. You can test you code
with the provided index.html file by opening it in the browser.

### Task 2
Open the folder Task 2
You second task is to debug a simple JavaScript script. The function is supposed to change the text, and background color
of the elements on the page. **The code contains 3 errors in total.**
Use the browser developer tools to debug the code. To get started, open the index.html file
in your browser and open the developer tools to check for errors.

### Task 3
Open the folder Task 3
Your third task is to finish the object creation script with more complex structures. Complete the TODOs in the JavaScript file.
And test them by opening the index.html file in your browser. Test the code between the TODOs with different parameters and
see what they do to the final object.
